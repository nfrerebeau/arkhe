This package provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic matrix data type (abundance matrix and stratigraphic matrix) upon which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g. predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent chronological data) are implemented.</p>",
