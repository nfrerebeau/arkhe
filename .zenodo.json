    "description": "<p>A collection of classes that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic matrix data type (absolute/relative frequency, presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g. summary statistics, predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent stratigraphic relationships) are implemented.</p>",
