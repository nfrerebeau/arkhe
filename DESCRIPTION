Description: A collection of classes that represent
    archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that
    represent different special types of matrix (absolute/relative
    frequency, presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon
    which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set
    of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions
    (e.g. summary statistics, predicates). In addition, a few classes of 
    general interest (e.g. that represent stratigraphic relationships) 
    are implemented.
