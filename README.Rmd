## Overview

A collection of classes that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic matrix data type (abundance matrix and stratigraphic matrix) upon which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g. predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent chronological data) are implemented.

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of **codex** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("codex")
```

Or-->You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("nfrerebeau/codex")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
# Load the package
library(codex)
```

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
# See the vignette
utils::vignette("codex", package = "codex")
```

**codex** provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic `matrix` data type. These new classes represent different special types of matrix.

* Numeric matrix:
    * `CountMatrix` represents absolute frequency data,
    * `AbundanceMatrix` represents relative frequency data,
    * `OccurrenceMatrix` represents a co-occurrence matrix,
    * `SimilarityMatrix` represents a (dis)similarity matrix,
* Logical matrix:
    * `IncidenceMatrix` represents presence/absence data,
    * `StratigraphicMatrix` represents stratigraphic relationships.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (assemblage/sample) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use, on the same way as the base `matrix`:

```{r create}
# Define a count data matrix
quanti <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Define a logical matrix
# Data will be coerced with as.logical()
quali <- IncidenceMatrix(data = sample(0:1, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
```

**codex** uses coercing mechanisms (with validation methods) for data type conversions:

```{r coerce}
## Create a count matrix
A0 <- matrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

## Coerce to absolute frequencies
A1 <- as_count(A0)

## Coerce to relative frequencies
B <- as_abundance(A1)

## Row sums are internally stored before coercing to a frequency matrix
## (use get_totals() to get these values)
## This allows to restore the source data
A2 <- as_count(B)
all(A1 == A2)

## Coerce to presence/absence
C <- as_incidence(A1)

## Coerce to a co-occurrence matrix
D <- as_occurrence(A1)
```

Represent stratigraphic relationships:

```{r stratigraphy}
# Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy, fig. 12
harris <- read.table(
  header = TRUE,
  text = "lower upper
          2     1
          3     1
          4     1
          5     2
          5     3
          5     4
          6     5
          7     1
          7     6
          8     1
          8     6
          9     7
          9     8"
)

as_stratigraphy(harris)
```
