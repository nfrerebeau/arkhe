## Overview

A collection of classes that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix (absolute/relative frequency, presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g. predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent stratigraphic relationships) are implemented.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **arkhe** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("arkhe")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nfrerebeau/arkhe")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
# Load the package
library(arkhe)
```

**arkhe** provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix.

* Integer matrix:
    * `CountMatrix` represents absolute frequency data,
* Numeric matrix:
    * `AbundanceMatrix` represents relative frequency data,
    * `OccurrenceMatrix` represents a co-occurrence matrix,
    * `SimilarityMatrix` represents a (dis)similarity matrix,
* Logical matrix:
    * `IncidenceMatrix` represents presence/absence data,
    * `StratigraphicMatrix` represents stratigraphic relationships.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (assemblage/sample) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use, on the same way as the base `matrix`:

```{r create}
# Define a count data matrix
# (data will be rounded to zero decimal places, then coerced with as.integer)
quanti <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Define a logical matrix
# (data will be coerced with as.logical)
quali <- IncidenceMatrix(data = sample(0:1, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
```

**arkhe** uses coercing mechanisms (with validation methods) for data type conversions:

```{r coerce}
## Create a count matrix
A0 <- matrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

## Coerce to absolute frequencies
A1 <- as_count(A0)

## Coerce to relative frequencies
B <- as_abundance(A1)

## Row sums are internally stored before coercing to a frequency matrix
## (use get_totals() to get these values)
## This allows to restore the source data
A2 <- as_count(B)
all(A1 == A2)

## Coerce to presence/absence
C <- as_incidence(A1)

## Coerce to a co-occurrence matrix
D <- as_occurrence(A1)
```

Many familiar methods and group generic functions are available for all `*Matrix` classes (such as `length`, `dim`, `rowSums`, `rowMeans`, `Arith`, `Compare`, `Logic`...). In addition, all functions that call `as.matrix` or `as.data.frame` first on their main argument should work (e. g. `apply`).

```{r functions}
rowSums(A1)
apply(X = A1, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)
```

Please note that all `*Matrix` classes extend the R base `matrix`, but the S3 part of the object **does not** store the data. Values are stored in a specific slot (allowing type checking).

```{r s3}
X <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 25, TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

## Get the S3 part
S3Part(X, strictS3 = TRUE)

## Coerce to an S3 matrix
as.matrix(X)
```
