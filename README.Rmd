## Overview

A collection of classes that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic matrix data type and a set of generic methods and functions. In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent time and space information) are implemented.

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of **codex** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("codex")
```

Or-->You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("nfrerebeau/codex")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
# Load package
library(codex)
```

### Matrix
**codex** provides a set of S4 classes that extend the basic `matrix` data type. These new classes represent different special types of matrix.

* Abundance matrix:
    * `CountMatrix` represents count data,
    * `FrequencyMatrix` represents relative frequency data.
* Logical matrix:
    * `IncidenceMatrix` represents presence/absence data.
* Other numeric matrix:
    * `OccurrenceMatrix` represents a co-occurrence matrix.
    * `SimilarityMatrix` represents a (dis)similarity matrix.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample/case) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use, on the same way as the base `matrix`:

```{r create, eval=FALSE}
# Define a count data matrix
quanti <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE),
                      nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Define a logical matrix
# Data will be coerced with as.logical()
quali <- IncidenceMatrix(data = sample(0:1, 100, TRUE),
                         nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
```

**codex** uses coercing mechanisms (with validation methods) for data type conversions:

```{r coerce}
## Create a count matrix
A1 <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE),
                  nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

## Coerce counts to frequencies
B <- as_frequency(A1)

## Row sums are internally stored before coercing to a frequency matrix
## (use totals() to get these values)
## This allows to restore the source data
A2 <- as_count(B)
all(A1 == A2)

## Coerce to presence/absence
C <- as_incidence(A1)

## Coerce to a co-occurrence matrix
D <- as_occurrence(A1)
```
